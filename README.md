# What is your age?

•This is my first application in Kotlin, with Jetpack Compose.

•The purpose is for the user to inform their age, using 2 buttons, one to increase the age and another to decrease it.

•The application informs at the end whether the user is under or over the age limit.

•There is a limit, from 0 to 130 years old.
